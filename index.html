                    As technology reshapes work, it leaves behind rich data trails that allow us to study skills, careers, firm practices, and policies in unprecedented detail. My research focuses on creatively using this big data to study the world of work, addressing questions of practical interest for both firms and policy. A second area of my research involves designing data-driven approaches to human capital management in firms, using real-world data and rules.

                    I am a PhD Candidate in Information Systems at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. In my dissertation, we introduce a novel approach to identify key skills for occupations using skill embeddings derived from vacancy postings. Applying this skill-space mapping, we examine occupational transitions influenced by ICT adoption across various jobs. Our findings reveal two key patterns for workers in ICT-exposed occupations: First, those who transition tend to move to jobs with more closely related skill sets compared to workers exiting less ICT-exposed roles, and generally benefit from these transitions. Second, workers in these same ICT-exposed occupations also face a higher risk of transitions indicative of skill obsolescence, contrasting with their counterparts in less ICT-exposed occupations.

                    In another research project, we develop a data-analytic approach using commonly available HR process data to show in the context of a large IT division, how firms can predict the selection likelihood of their current employees to new and emerging positions. When applied as a measure of the employee's prospect within the firm, it predicts employee application for internal mobility in systematic ways; thereby opening the ability of firms to fine tune their employee development towards skill development or practices that facilitate mobility.

                <p>
                    I am involved in research projects i) tracking adoption of AI and analytics across firms over time and its linkages to human capital and ii) the ability of firms to engage specialized remote workers and its effect on regular careers. Other areas of research interest include the technology disruption in entertainment media and behavioral data science.

                    I am on the Job Market (2024-25).
