                <h2>Academic Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    My dissertation develops a data analytic approach that mines widely available HR process data to enhance understanding of internal mobility patterns and skill development within firms. This approach sheds new light on the dynamics of employee movement and competency growth, guiding practitioners towards strategies that can improve internal mobility pathways and targeted skill acquisition processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work in skills and mobility also extends to a broader scale, developing a nuanced understanding of worker-flow to and from occupations exposed to technological change. In another active research project, we bring new evidence on a practical problem -- the features of an inclusive banking account and its role as a commitment device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in research projects that study digital transformations of sectors (such as streaming media and program quality) and the development of data-driven decision approaches in complex economic environments. My research benefits from the guidance and collaboration of very accomplished and generous researchers.

                <p>
                    Originally from Kerala, India, I currently reside in Pittsburgh with my wife, Sweety Sidhu. In my free time, I appreciate good food, enjoy watching TV series, and find the fall colors particularly pleasant.
